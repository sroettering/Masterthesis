=== Everyday Life Music Information-Seeking Behaviour of Young Adults ===
Satisficing & Selection
It has been widely observed that music listeners often have
no particular song in mind when engaging with a music sys-
tem  and  instead  browse  for  a  suitable  piece  of  music  [16].
This activity of finding the first ‘good enough’ item is termed
satisficing
whereas trying to optimise to find the best option
is termed
maximising
.  Schwartz et al. explored maximising
versus satisficing as a personality construct, claiming that in-
dividuals vary with respect to how much they optimise selec-
tions [22].  Whether a user wishes to satisfice or make more
exact selections will also depend upon their present context
and  how  much  they  wish  to  engage  in  the  music  retrieval.
Where users do not wish to expend any effort,  they turn to
recommendation or random shuffling, seeking a serendipitous
music selection [17].
